<h1>About Me</h1>
</body>
<body>
  My name is Emma Riemann. I live in Cheshire,CT. I am a sophmore at Cheshire Academy. I like to play sports, like soccer and tennis. When I am not playing sports, I enjoy hanging out with my friends. I like to travel a lot. I have been to many countries outside of the U.S, like Canada and Italy. I like to go to the beach with my friends and family. I also like going into New York City.
<h2>My School</h2>
I go to a small boarding school in Cheshire called Cheshire Academy. There are around 400 students and around 70 in my grade. Since I go to a boarding school, we are required to do two competitive activities each season. Last year I did soccer and lacrosse. If you are not athletic you can do the musical/play and have that count as your competitive activities. I like my school.

  <h2>Why I Built this Website </h2>
  I built this website to showcase the skills I learned in the Holberton coding summer camp. This website will showcase all of the projects we have done in the past two weeks, like embeding, links, images, formatting, and much more.
